This project focus on the drivers for the compensation.

# Environment Set up
* Python 3.8 and Jupyter notebook is used for the analysis
* Libraries used:
  * pandas
  * pandas_profiling
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn

# Motivation
* The idea is to explore what factor can impact the compensation. It give a preliminary answer to the following three questions:
  * Q1: Does big company have more competitive salary?
  * Q2: Doe high education worth the price?
  * Q3: Does stack overflow help if you actively contribute to the forum?

# Repository structure
* Data: include raw data, schema and report
* analysis.ipynb: the main analysis code

# Results
* From the EDA, it's clear that generally speaking, big companies do pay higher compensations. And participate in stack overflow forum do helps. However, it's a little bit counter-intuitive that graduate degree do not guarantee a higher compensations than a bachelor's degree.
